# Working on ideas

Anyone is welcomed to contribute. However it is important to keep the housekeeping in order. When working on new ideas, pick the ones planned in a release and communicate to the other contributors. If an idea is not in the planned features document or on a board, open a discussion to keep people aware.

Next create a project board to help in the development or extend a release board, based on the agreed process.

Create a new feature branch or fork the project. Develop the functionality and prepare or update the documentation. Once all is tested and ready to be shared, submit a pull request with the develop branch.
