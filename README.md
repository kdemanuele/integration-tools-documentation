# Integration Tools

Integrations are a means for different systems to exchange data using mechanisms to Extract, Transform and Load between the systems. A multitude of technologies are available to build and manage integrations, some concentrating on the entire integration process, like Azure Data Factory with Dataflows or PowerQuery, PowerQuery, MuleSoft, Talent, AWS Glue and more. There are other technologies that concentrate on the Extracting and Loading the data, like Azure Logic App Connectors, simple REST APIs, Microsoft RPA, AWS Glue, Dapr, etc.

With all these technologies around, still the majority of the projects attempt to build their own mechanisms or use a combination of technologies. There is no real right or wrong approaches, as all depends on the requirements and targets to reach.

Great so too many technologies out there doing the same things and still building custom solution

## So why another project to simplify the integrations?

The aim of this project is to tackle the integrations from a different perspective. Rather than providing a solution, the project aims to provide a collection of tools and pattern bases that can be used in a project to deliver the solution quicker. The project consists in a number of repositories all targeting a specific area of the intended project.

## Where does this project fits in the global project

As the project is divided into several projects, it can become cumbersome to find which project or assets are needed. To minimize the impact introduced by the segregation of projects, a central documentation is provided, within this repository.

## Documentation

Documentation for the project can be found on [GitHub Pages](https://kdemanuele.github.io/integration-tools-documentation/).
